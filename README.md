#5.-Snake-Game

This is my first JavaScript game using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
It is a re-make of the classic Nokia 3310 game (a throwback for the generation of that time).
The game has a few options:
* You can have the speed of the snake at a normal pace or much faster aka EXTREME speed by entering either 'N' or 'E'
* You can also have the option to have the walls UP or DOWN by entering either 'U' or 'D' - The wall up means that if you hit the wall, the game is over (more traditional way of playing) - Selecting to have NO walls, means you can enter and exit in all 4 directions to get to the apple. Exiting at the top of the screen will allow for the snake to appear in the same postion but at the bottom of the screen (the same also applies to left and right positions).
* Once you have selected your options, it is time to hit the letter 'S' and start playing.
* The directions are controlled by the Arrow keys.
